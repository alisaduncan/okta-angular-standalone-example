# Okta Angular Standalone Example

This project is an example app demonstrating using Okta in a standalone Angular application.

The project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.0.3.

## Get going

Download the code project. Install dependencies by running `npm ci`. Replace the Okta Domain and Okta Application Client Id in the app.config.ts with your values. Serve the project by running `npm start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Disclaimer

This project is a quick demonstration and still needs automated tests, test server to showcase interceptor, and more.
